# Grid Search Algorithms Visualizer
This project shows how BFS, DFS, UCS, and DLS search algorithms work on a 9x9 grid using Python.
It helps you see how these algorithms find paths step by step.
 ##What You Need
•	Python 3.8 or above
•	Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (with Python extension)
•	Git (optional, for cloning the project)
##Install Libraries
Run this command in your terminal or VS Code terminal:
pip install matplotlib numpy tk
## How to Run
1.	Open the file Part1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2.	Run all the cells one by one.
3.	You’ll see a grid where the algorithm moves step by step toward the goal.
## Used Libraries
•	tkinter to shows the grid animation
•	collections to handles queues/stacks for algorithms
•	matplotlib and numpy to used for grid display (if needed)
•	time to controls animation speed
## Purpose
This project helps beginners understand how search algorithms work in a simple and visual way.
It’s great for learning AI basics, pathfinding, or Operating Systems concepts.
